Use Cases
---------

The {+intellij-full+} enables you to run queries written in Java directly 
in the Database Explorer playgrounds. 

The Run button appears next to your MongoDB queries.

   :alt: Click the Run button to convert your Java query to mongosh syntax.

Behavior
--------

When you click the Run button, the plugin automatically:

- Converts your Java query to ``mongosh`` syntax. 
- Maps it directly to your original query. 
- Opens a Playground file with the populated query.

Example
-------

The code example below shows the converted query from the code in the 
image above.

.. code:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   var driver_id = ""

   db.getSiblingsDB("production")
     .getCollection("trips")
     .find( { 
        "$and": [ 
           { "trips.status" : "completed" },
           { "driver_id" : driver_id }
        ]
      )

In this example, ``driver_id`` is a variable that holds a value 
determined at runtime. For field values that are variables determined 
at runtime, the plugin creates a placeholder variable. You can populate 
this placeholder with a test value and run the query in the playground. 

Once you are satisfied with the query, you can run it in the playground 
and view the query results.
